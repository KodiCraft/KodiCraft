hi! im kodi

i am a computer science student who does silly shit in her free time. on this repository you can find whatever projects i decided to work on for 5-8 hours before getting tired of them

i also try to sometimes contribute to public projects but i sometimes struggle with actually wriing anything worthwhile

thanks for looking around!
