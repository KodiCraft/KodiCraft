I am Kodi or Kody, I am a computer science studying, aiming to be a software architect or something like that idk

I "work" on a couple of neat open-source projects, but I tend to get overambitious and/or give up on a number of projects, so I apologize if something I made doesn't get much support.

I'm always open to try to fix issues with my stuff though, let me know if I fuck up!

Also, as a student, I don't have the best knowledge of industry standards and common behaviour, but I'm always open to learn! Let me know about style issues, or bad practice, but please don't be mean.
