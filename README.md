hi! im kodi

i am a computer science student who does silly shit in her free time. on this repository you can find whatever projects i decided to work on for 5-8 hours before getting tired of them

i try to keep my blog at [kdcf.me](https://www.kdcf.me) up to date on whatever stuff im doing to showcase my projects and the thought process behind them

i also try to sometimes contribute to public projects but i sometimes struggle with actually wriing anything worthwhile

thanks for looking around!
